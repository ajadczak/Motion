Motion
======

Some 3D stuff based on Frank Luna's DX11 book. This demo generates simple terrain that warps based on a sine function with vertex colors that interpolate based on height. This means tall terrain becomes white peaked mountains and medium terrain becomes green grass. This code differs from the book version since this code does not depend on the effects 11 framework for compiling and loading shaders and setting constant buffers.
